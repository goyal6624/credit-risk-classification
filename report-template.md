## Overview of the Analysis

In this section, describe the analysis you completed for the machine learning models used in this Challenge. This might include:

* Explain the purpose of the analysis.
* Explain what financial information the data was on, and what you needed to predict.
* Provide basic information about the variables you were trying to predict (e.g., `value_counts`).
* Describe the stages of the machine learning process you went through as part of this analysis.
* Briefly touch on any methods you used (e.g., `LogisticRegression`, or any resampling method).

This model was an exercise on supervised machine learning with data from a lending services company. The idea was to classify a loan and predict whether the loans would be healthy or high risk. I used logictic regression model for this.

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
  * The logistic regression model I created has a pretty high accuracy score of 0.952, a precision score of 0.847 and a recall score of 0.910

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. 

I recommend using the logistic model that I created because it has a quite high balanced accuracy score at 95%. It does a great job at predicting healthy loans, which a precision of 1.00 and a recall of 0.99.
